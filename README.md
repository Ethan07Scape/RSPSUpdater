# RSPSUpdater

A WIP updater that can support any jar you decide to run through it. 

The main goal is to allow anyone to create an updater without having the knowledge to create the whole system. They simple create the visitors and the patterns and let the engine do the rest.


The engine is heavily inspired by OSRSAnalysis by SwipeX.
